# Reburn 3

A work-in-progress open source reimplementation of *Burnout 3: Takedown*.

## Goals

**Reburn 3** is a faithful recreation of *Burnout 3: Takedown* via reverse engineering the original game. It is not intended to be a byte-accurate decompilation, it is more akin to a rewrite (hence "open source reimplementation"). The code will be ported to use platform-independent libraries, and support high resolutions and frame rates.

The ultimate goal is to allow the Burnout community to easily expand and modify the game, adding content or running the game on new hardware.

## Method

Reburn 3 is currently playable on Windows (and Wine) utilizing [Cxbx-Reloaded](https://github.com/Cxbx-Reloaded/Cxbx-Reloaded) as a compatibility layer (see [Proof of Concept](https://github.com/reburndev/reburn3/releases/tag/proof-of-concept)). Eventually, as the game becomes fully reimplemented, it will become a fully portable/independent codebase with no dependency on any compatibility layers, however that will be fairly late in the process.
